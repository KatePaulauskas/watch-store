### Project Link

The live store is located at the following [address]().


## Agile Methodology

This project was executed using the Agile framework, promoting iterative progress and adaptability. The Agile approach was employed to plan and monitor the project's advancements. Agile principles were consistently applied through various tools and techniques:

**Planning and Monitoring:**

All user stories were systematically managed via GitHub Issues and Projects, ensuring an organised and methodical workflow.

**Custom Templates:**

Each user story was documented using custom templates, which included sections such as the user story, acceptance criteria, and tasks. This standardisation facilitated easier management and tracking of progress for each story.

**MoSCoW Prioritisation:**

To prioritise tasks, the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won’t have) was utilised with labels. This prioritisation method helped categorise the importance of each user story, ensuring that essential features were developed first within an iteration, while less critical features were scheduled for later development if necessary. The implementation can be reviewed [here](https://github.com/KatePaulauskas/watch-store/issues).

**Kanban Board Management:** 

A Kanban board within GitHub Projects was used to manage user stories, divided into three columns: Todo, In Progress, and Done. This provided clear visibility into the project's status at any given time. The board can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/KatePaulauskas/projects/4).

**Milestones and Iterative Progress:**

Milestones were established to define the project's iterations and were linked to the project epics. Each user story was allocated to one of six iterations, ensuring a structured development process and smooth progress tracking. The project milestones can be seen [here](https://github.com/KatePaulauskas/watch-store/milestones).

By leveraging these Agile practices and tools, the project maintained a clear and organised structure, allowing for effective tracking and timely completion of all 41 user stories.

### Surface
At the Surface Plane, the visual design of the site was developed, with a strong focus on the overall look and feel of the site.

#### Colour Scheme

The colours for the Eternity Luxury Watch Store site were carefully chosen using the [Coolors tool](https://coolors.co/) to establish a brand identity that exudes both luxury and sophistication. 

![Colour Scheme](media/color-pallet.webp)

Each color plays a critical role in creating an inviting and refined user experience, while also ensuring that the website conveys the premium quality of the products.

- **Dark Green (#113227ff):** Serving as the primary background color, dark green was chosen for its association with wealth, stability, and timeless elegance. This deep, rich tone provides a strong foundation that enhances the perception of luxury and makes the site feel both exclusive and grounded.

- **Ecru (#e4c58aff):** Ecru is used for most of the text and main accents across the site. Its warm, neutral tone ensures readability while adding a touch of understated elegance. This color complements the darker background, creating a harmonious balance that is both inviting and visually pleasing.

- **Lion (#aa9159ff), Licorice (#230903ff), and Seasalt (#fbfaf8ff):** These colors are strategically employed throughout the site to add contrast and highlight important elements. The rich and sophisticated tones of lion and licorice, paired with the soft and clean seasalt, ensure that the overall design remains luxurious while also being visually dynamic and engaging. These colors work together to create a cohesive aesthetic that reflects the brand’s commitment to quality and timeless elegance.

The combination of these carefully selected colors creates a cohesive and luxurious aesthetic that embodies the brand’s dedication to offering timeless, high-quality watches. The palette strikes a balance between bold, rich tones and elegant neutrals, ensuring that the website appeals to discerning customers who value both style and substance.

#### Typography

The fonts for the Eternity Luxury Watch Store site were thoughtfully chosen using the font pairing service [Font Joy](https://fontjoy.com/) to ensure a visually appealing and cohesive design. Each font was selected to enhance the user experience and reflect the brand's identity.

![Typography Font Paring](/media/typography-font-paring.webp)


Choosing the right fonts is essential for conveying the luxury and sophistication that aligns with the brand's identity. The selected fonts for the Eternity Luxury Watch Store have been chosen to reflect elegance, readability, and a modern aesthetic. Below is an explanation of the selected fonts and why they are suitable for the site:

1. **Primary Heading Font: "Cormorant Unicase" (Serif)**
   
   - **Elegance and Uniqueness:** Cormorant Unicase is a serif font that brings a touch of classical elegance with a unique twist. The unicase design, where uppercase and lowercase letters share similar heights, adds a distinct character that makes the headings stand out. This is particularly important for luxury brands, where uniqueness and attention to detail are highly valued.
   - **Luxurious Appeal:** The fine strokes and sophisticated letterforms of Cormorant Unicase resonate with the luxury market, aligning with the timeless and refined nature of high-end watches. It sets a distinguished tone for the brand, making it ideal for the main headings (H1).

2. **Secondary Heading Font: "Antic" (Sans-Serif)**
   
   - **Simplicity and Clarity:** Antic is a sans-serif font that offers a clean, modern look. It is straightforward and highly legible, which makes it an excellent choice for secondary headings (H2-H6). Its simplicity complements the more ornate Cormorant Unicase, creating a balanced visual hierarchy on the page.
   - **Modern Touch:** While Cormorant Unicase delivers a classic feel, Antic introduces a modern touch, ensuring the website resonates with contemporary audiences. This fusion of traditional and modern elements mirrors the brand's dedication to offering luxury watches that are timeless, innovative and accessible.

3. **Body Text Font: "Muli" (Sans-Serif)**
   
   - **Readability and Functionality:** Muli is a sans-serif font that is optimized for on-screen readability. It’s clean and minimalistic, which makes it ideal for large blocks of text, such as product descriptions and informational content. The font ensures that the text is easy to read, enhancing the user experience.
   - **Subtle and Neutral:** Muli's subtle design does not distract from the content, allowing the luxury watches to remain the focal point. Its neutral appearance complements the more expressive heading fonts, ensuring a cohesive and harmonious overall design.

#### Visual Representation of Font Pairing

- **Headings (H1):** Cormorant Unicase
- **Subheadings (H2-H6):** Antic
- **Body Text (Paragraphs):** Muli

These fonts were selected to create a visual hierarchy that conveys luxury, clarity, and modernity. **Cormorant Unicase** adds a unique and elegant touch to the primary headings, making a strong brand statement. **Antic** provides simplicity and modernity to the secondary headings, ensuring that the design remains clean and accessible. Finally, **Muli** ensures that all body text is highly readable and functional, supporting a seamless user experience across the site.

By integrating these fonts, the Eternity Luxury Watch Store website can effectively communicate its brand values of elegance, precision, and timelessness, while also offering a modern and user-friendly interface.

**Backdrop Font**

In addition to the selected fonts, the backdrop font across the website is also sans-serif. This backdrop enhances the modern and clean aesthetic, supporting the visual hierarchy and helping foreground content pop against a clear, unobtrusive background.

## Deployment

The luxury watch store Eternity website is hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com), a container-based cloud platform designed for app development, deployment, and management. It was deployed following the steps below.

### Part 1: Create a New App

1. **Log into [Heroku](https://heroku.com) Account**

2. **Create a New App:**
- Select 'New' in the top-right corner of the Heroku Dashboard.
- Choose 'Create new app' from the drop-down menu.
- Enter the app name 'eternity-watch-store' and select Europe as the region.
- Click 'Create App'.

3. **Access Settings and Configure Environment Variables:**
- Go to the 'Settings' tab of the created app.
- Click on 'Config Vars'.
- Add the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` key with a value of `1`.
- Click 'Add'.
- Add the `SECRET_KEY` with a value in the following format: `secret key`.
- Click 'Add'.

### Part 2 - Update Code for Deployment

1. **Prepare Dependencies:**
- In the workspace terminal, run the command to create a `requirements.txt` file with the project's dependencies for each project dependency, while working on the project:

```
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

2. **Install Gunicorn:**
- Install the web server Gunicorn:

```
    pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1
```

- Add Gunicorn to the project requirements:

```
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

3. **Create a Procfile:**
- Create a `Procfile` at the root directory of the project.
- Declare the process as `web` and add a start command:

```
    web: gunicorn watch-store.wsgi
```

4. **Update Project settings.py File:**
- Change `DEBUG` to `False`:

```
    DEBUG = False
```

- Add `'.herokuapp.com'` to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in the project settings:

```
     ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    '8000-katepaulausk-watchstore-26htz3q089y.ws.codeinstitute-ide.net',
    '.herokuapp.com']
```

5. **Push Updated Code to GitHub**

### Part 3 - Deployment with Static Files

To ensure the deployed app looks as nicely styled as the local development version, the project was deployed with static files using the WhiteNoise Python package by following the steps below:

1. **Install and Set Up the Python Package:**

- Install WhiteNoise:

```
    pip3 install whitenoise~=5.3.0
```

- Add WhiteNoise to the project requirements:

```
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

- Integrate WhiteNoise into Django's `MIDDLEWARE` in the `groomingsalon/settings.py` file, ensuring it is placed right after the Django `SecurityMiddleware`:
```
     MIDDLEWARE = [
         'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
         'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
         # Other middleware...
     ]
```

2. **Create a Static Files Directory and Collect Static Files:**
- Set the `STATIC_ROOT` path in the `groomingsalon/settings.py` file:

```
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
```

- Run the `collectstatic` command in the terminal to gather static files into the `staticfiles` directory:

```
    python3 manage.py collectstatic
```

3. **Deployment:**

- Check the Python version by running:

```
    python3 -V
```

- From the [supported runtimes](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#specifying-a-python-version), copy the runtime closest to the current Python version.

- Add a `runtime.txt` file to the project's root directory with the copied Python version: `python-3.12.5`.

- Set `DEBUG` to `False` and push the changes to GitHub.

- Open the Heroku dashboard, go to the app 'Settings' tab, and under 'Reveal config vars', remove the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` key/value pair.

### Part 4 - Set Up Deployment from GitHub

1. **Set Up Deployment from GitHub:**

- In the Heroku dashboard, switch to the 'Deploy' tab.

- Choose 'GitHub' as the deployment method and connect the GitHub account.

- In the search bar, type the repository name `watch-store` and click 'Search' to find it on GitHub.

- Click 'Connect' to link the Heroku app to the GitHub repository.

2. **Deploy the App:**
- Click 'Deploy Branch' to manually deploy the app.

- Wait for the app to build. Once ready, the message “Your app was successfully deployed” appears.

3. **View Deployed App:**

- Click on the 'View' button to see the deployed project.

The deployed project link can be found at the following URL: [Eternity - Luxury Watch Store](https://eternity-watch-store-1f855f4289ad.herokuapp.com/).
