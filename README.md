### Project Link

The live store is located at the following [address](https://eternity-watch-store-1f855f4289ad.herokuapp.com/).


## Agile Methodology

This project was executed using the Agile framework, promoting iterative progress and adaptability. The Agile approach was employed to plan and monitor the project's advancements. Agile principles were consistently applied through various tools and techniques:

**Planning and Monitoring:**

All user stories were systematically managed via GitHub Issues and Projects, ensuring an organised and methodical workflow.

**Custom Templates:**

Each user story was documented using custom templates, which included sections such as the user story, acceptance criteria, and tasks. This standardisation facilitated easier management and tracking of progress for each story.

**MoSCoW Prioritisation:**

To prioritise tasks, the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won’t have) was utilised with labels. This prioritisation method helped categorise the importance of each user story, ensuring that essential features were developed first within an iteration, while less critical features were scheduled for later development if necessary. The implementation can be reviewed [here](https://github.com/KatePaulauskas/watch-store/issues).

**Kanban Board Management:** 

A Kanban board within GitHub Projects was used to manage user stories, divided into three columns: Todo, In Progress, and Done. This provided clear visibility into the project's status at any given time. The board can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/KatePaulauskas/projects/4).

**Milestones and Iterative Progress:**

Milestones were established to define the project's iterations and were linked to the project epics. Each user story was allocated to one of six iterations, ensuring a structured development process and smooth progress tracking. The project milestones can be seen [here](https://github.com/KatePaulauskas/watch-store/milestones).

By leveraging these Agile practices and tools, the project maintained a clear and organised structure, allowing for effective tracking and timely completion of all 41 user stories.

![Database Structure](/media/database-structure.png)

**Core Models**

* **Product:**
     Represents the items available for purchase in the store, including details such as name, SKU, price, description, and availability status. Each product belongs to multiple categories and may have add-ons associated with it.

* **Category:**
     Defines the different groups or types of products (e.g., gender and brands).

* **ProductCategory:** 
     A junction table connecting Product and Category. The many-to-many relationship between products and categories allows products to belong to multiple categories.

* **AddOn:**
     Represents optional add-ons that can be purchased alongside a product, such as shipping insurance and extended warranty. Add-ons have an associated price and are linked to each product in an order.

* **Order:**
     Tracks each individual purchase made by a user. It stores details about the user, delivery information, associated add-ons, and payment details. The order model also keeps track of costs such as delivery and grand totals.

* **OrderLineItem:**
     Represents a specific product within an order. Each order can have multiple line items, tracking the quantity and total price of each product purchased.

These models together enable a seamless shopping experience, ensuring that customers can view, filter, and purchase products, while admins can manage orders, product listings, and important store policies effectively.

### Surface
At the Surface Plane, the visual design of the site was developed, with a strong focus on the overall look and feel of the site.

#### Colour Scheme

The colours for the Eternity Luxury Watch Store site were carefully chosen using the [Coolors tool](https://coolors.co/) to establish a brand identity that exudes both luxury and sophistication. 

![Colour Scheme](media/color-pallet.webp)

Each color plays a critical role in creating an inviting and refined user experience, while also ensuring that the website conveys the premium quality of the products.

- **Dark Green (#113227ff):** Serving as the primary background color, dark green was chosen for its association with wealth, stability, and timeless elegance. This deep, rich tone provides a strong foundation that enhances the perception of luxury and makes the site feel both exclusive and grounded.

- **Ecru (#e4c58aff):** Ecru is used for most of the text and main accents across the site. Its warm, neutral tone ensures readability while adding a touch of understated elegance. This color complements the darker background, creating a harmonious balance that is both inviting and visually pleasing.

- **Lion (#aa9159ff), Licorice (#230903ff), and Seasalt (#fbfaf8ff):** These colors are strategically employed throughout the site to add contrast and highlight important elements. The rich and sophisticated tones of lion and licorice, paired with the soft and clean seasalt, ensure that the overall design remains luxurious while also being visually dynamic and engaging. These colors work together to create a cohesive aesthetic that reflects the brand’s commitment to quality and timeless elegance.

The combination of these carefully selected colors creates a cohesive and luxurious aesthetic that embodies the brand’s dedication to offering timeless, high-quality watches. The palette strikes a balance between bold, rich tones and elegant neutrals, ensuring that the website appeals to discerning customers who value both style and substance.

#### Typography

The fonts for the Eternity Luxury Watch Store site were thoughtfully chosen using the font pairing service [Font Joy](https://fontjoy.com/) to ensure a visually appealing and cohesive design. Each font was selected to enhance the user experience and reflect the brand's identity.

![Typography Font Paring](/media/typography-font-paring.webp)


Choosing the right fonts is essential for conveying the luxury and sophistication that aligns with the brand's identity. The selected fonts for the Eternity Luxury Watch Store have been chosen to reflect elegance, readability, and a modern aesthetic. Below is an explanation of the selected fonts and why they are suitable for the site:

1. **Primary Heading Font: "Cormorant Unicase" (Serif)**
   
   - **Elegance and Uniqueness:** Cormorant Unicase is a serif font that brings a touch of classical elegance with a unique twist. The unicase design, where uppercase and lowercase letters share similar heights, adds a distinct character that makes the headings stand out. This is particularly important for luxury brands, where uniqueness and attention to detail are highly valued.
   - **Luxurious Appeal:** The fine strokes and sophisticated letterforms of Cormorant Unicase resonate with the luxury market, aligning with the timeless and refined nature of high-end watches. It sets a distinguished tone for the brand, making it ideal for the main headings (H1).

2. **Secondary Heading Font: "Antic" (Sans-Serif)**
   
   - **Simplicity and Clarity:** Antic is a sans-serif font that offers a clean, modern look. It is straightforward and highly legible, which makes it an excellent choice for secondary headings (H2-H6). Its simplicity complements the more ornate Cormorant Unicase, creating a balanced visual hierarchy on the page.
   - **Modern Touch:** While Cormorant Unicase delivers a classic feel, Antic introduces a modern touch, ensuring the website resonates with contemporary audiences. This fusion of traditional and modern elements mirrors the brand's dedication to offering luxury watches that are timeless, innovative and accessible.

3. **Body Text Font: "Muli" (Sans-Serif)**
   
   - **Readability and Functionality:** Muli is a sans-serif font that is optimized for on-screen readability. It’s clean and minimalistic, which makes it ideal for large blocks of text, such as product descriptions and informational content. The font ensures that the text is easy to read, enhancing the user experience.
   - **Subtle and Neutral:** Muli's subtle design does not distract from the content, allowing the luxury watches to remain the focal point. Its neutral appearance complements the more expressive heading fonts, ensuring a cohesive and harmonious overall design.

#### Visual Representation of Font Pairing

- **Headings (H1):** Cormorant Unicase
- **Subheadings (H2-H6):** Antic
- **Body Text (Paragraphs):** Muli

These fonts were selected to create a visual hierarchy that conveys luxury, clarity, and modernity. **Cormorant Unicase** adds a unique and elegant touch to the primary headings, making a strong brand statement. **Antic** provides simplicity and modernity to the secondary headings, ensuring that the design remains clean and accessible. Finally, **Muli** ensures that all body text is highly readable and functional, supporting a seamless user experience across the site.

By integrating these fonts, the Eternity Luxury Watch Store website can effectively communicate its brand values of elegance, precision, and timelessness, while also offering a modern and user-friendly interface.

**Backdrop Font**

In addition to the selected fonts, the backdrop font across the website is also sans-serif. This backdrop enhances the modern and clean aesthetic, supporting the visual hierarchy and helping foreground content pop against a clear, unobtrusive background.

### Validator Testing

#### HTML
<details>
  <summary>HTML Testing</summary>

To ensure adherence to web standards and improve accessibility, the site's HTML was submitted to [W3C validation testing]().

* **Home Page**

     On the home page, the following issues and warning were identified: 

     **Error 1:**

     Attribute `product-name` not allowed on element `a` at this point.

     ![Home Page Errors Part One](/media/html-checker-home-page-errors-part-two.jpeg)

     **Solution:** since HTML strictly defines which attributes are allowed on `<a>` tags, to resolve the issue `data-*` attributes were used, therefore `product-name` was replaced with `data-product-name`. Source [Stack Overflow](/media/https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4962070/attribute-name-not-allowed-on-element-div-at-this-point).

     **Error 2:**

     Attribute `product-id` not allowed on element `a` at this point.

     ![Home Page Errors Part One](/media/html-checker-home-page-errors-part-three.jpeg)

     **Solution:** similar to previouse issue, `data-*` attributes were used on `<a>` tags, therefore `product-id` was replaced with `data-product-id`.

     **Warning 1:**

     Warning: The `type` attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources:

     ![Home Page Errors Part One](/media/html-checker-home-page-errors-part-one.jpeg)

     **Solution:** the `type` attribute was removed.

     Upon fixing the issues and warning home pages successfully passed the HTML checker:

The rest of the pages passed validation with no errors.

For compliance with web standards and accessibility guidelines, the site's CSS code was checked using the [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Feternity-watch-store-1f855f4289ad.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#errors). 

No errors were identified:

![CSS Validation](/media/css-validation.png)

However, 19 warnings were identified by the CSS Validator:

![css-validation-warnings.png](/media/css-validation-warnings.png)

Although these warnings were flagged, the use of vendor-prefixed properties and other CSS features was intentional to ensure cross-browser compatibility and a consistent user experience (UX) across different platforms. These warnings do not negatively impact the site's functionality or design. Here is a summary of the key issues and why they were implemented:

- **Vendor-Prefixed Properties** (-webkit, -moz, etc.): These are necessary to ensure that the design elements like shadows, transitions, and input autofill work correctly across browsers such as Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. Each browser may interpret CSS properties slightly differently, and vendor prefixes help maintain consistency. 

- **CSS Pseudo-Classes** (:-webkit-autofill): This was used specifically to style form fields that browsers automatically fill, ensuring they retain the site's design when a user’s browser autofills a form.

- **CSS Grid and Clamps** (-webkit-line-clamp): This property is used to control text overflow and ensure that long product names are truncated gracefully, improving readability and maintaining a clean UI layout.

These warnings do not affect the website’s performance and are essential to delivering a consistent design and experience across all devices and platforms.
