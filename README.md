### Project Link

The live store is located at the following [address]().


## Agile Methodology

This project was executed using the Agile framework, promoting iterative progress and adaptability. The Agile approach was employed to plan and monitor the project's advancements. Agile principles were consistently applied through various tools and techniques:

**Planning and Monitoring:**

All user stories were systematically managed via GitHub Issues and Projects, ensuring an organised and methodical workflow.

**Custom Templates:**

Each user story was documented using custom templates, which included sections such as the user story, acceptance criteria, and tasks. This standardisation facilitated easier management and tracking of progress for each story.

**MoSCoW Prioritisation:**

To prioritise tasks, the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won’t have) was utilised with labels. This prioritisation method helped categorise the importance of each user story, ensuring that essential features were developed first within an iteration, while less critical features were scheduled for later development if necessary. The implementation can be reviewed [here](https://github.com/KatePaulauskas/watch-store/issues).

**Kanban Board Management:** 

A Kanban board within GitHub Projects was used to manage user stories, divided into three columns: Todo, In Progress, and Done. This provided clear visibility into the project's status at any given time. The board can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/KatePaulauskas/projects/4).

**Milestones and Iterative Progress:**

Milestones were established to define the project's iterations and were linked to the project epics. Each user story was allocated to one of six iterations, ensuring a structured development process and smooth progress tracking. The project milestones can be seen [here](https://github.com/KatePaulauskas/watch-store/milestones).

By leveraging these Agile practices and tools, the project maintained a clear and organised structure, allowing for effective tracking and timely completion of all 41 user stories.
